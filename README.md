# Task4
 Develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.
 Project Description:
Developed a deep learning-based Hand Gesture Recognition model capable of accurately identifying and classifying various hand gestures from image or video input. This project aims to enhance gesture-based control systems and enable more intuitive human-computer interaction, especially useful in applications such as touchless interfaces, virtual reality (VR), sign language interpretation, and smart home automation.

🧠 Key Features:
📸 Image & Video Input: Supports real-time gesture recognition from webcam or pre-recorded footage.

🤖 CNN-Based Model: Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify gestures with high accuracy.

✋ Multi-Class Classification: Trained on a labeled dataset containing different static hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, stop, peace, etc.).

🔄 Real-Time Prediction: Integrated OpenCV for live video feed processing and frame-by-frame prediction.

📊 Performance Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy with detailed classification reports, confusion matrix, and visual feedback.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

CNN architecture for image classification

Real-time video processing with OpenCV

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for experimentation

🌐 Applications:
Touchless UI/UX for kiosks and devices
